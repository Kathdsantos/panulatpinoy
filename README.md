Panulat Pinoy

This program is intended to Filipino children to save their time writing down on their notebooks and to enhance their typing skills. The users can stay updated using laptops and computers through online.

I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, GitHub pages and firebase for the development. For the people who want to make changes on my project, it's useful to have some documentation on how to get started. I am open to any contributions regarding my project and you can message me on my email kathdsantos@yahoo.com for further questions.
